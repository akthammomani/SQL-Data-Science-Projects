   * The "Bookings" Table,
   * The "Facilities" Table, and
   * The "Members" Table.
   
       
### âœ° In this case study, there are 13 Questions we need to find answers to using: 
   * Questions 1-9 using **PHPMyAdmin interface (MySQL)** ðŸ‘‰ ***"SQLTasks Tier 2_PHPMyAdmin.sql"***
   * Questions 10-13 using **Python and SQLite** ðŸ‘‰ ***"country_club_python_sqlite_v3.ipynb"*** where we used sqlalchemy & SQLite to manipulate and transform the Data.
   
### âœ° Throughout this case study we've covered a wide variety of methods for transforming, manipulating, and calculating data to answer a wide variety of questions in SQL: 
   * We used CASE Statements for categorizing, aggregating and calculating information.
   * We used subqueries in FROM Clause.
   * We joined multiple tables.
   * We used nested and correlated subqueries to extract, match, and organize large amounts of data.   
   * We used Aggregation, ORDER BY, GROUB BY, WHERE and HAVING Clauses to filter and manipulate the Data.
