### ✰ Throughout these SQL Projects we've covered a wide variety of methods for transforming, manipulating, and calculating data to answer a wide variety of questions in SQL: 
   * We used CASE Statements for categorizing, aggregating and calculating information.
   * We used subqueries in FROM Clause.
   * We used nested and correlated subqueries to extract, match, and organize large amounts of data.   
   * We used ORDER BY, GROUB BY, WHERE and HAVING Clauses to filter and manipulate the Data.
